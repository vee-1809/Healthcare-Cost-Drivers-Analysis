# Healthcare Cost Drivers Analysis

**Goal:**  
Predict patient medical costs and analyze key cost drivers (like BMI, smoking, and region) using Python and Power BI.

---

##  **What I did**
- Explored a public insurance dataset with 1,300+ rows.
- Ran EDA to find which features drive higher costs.
- Encoded categorical data (sex, smoker, region).
- Trained a linear regression model:
  - **RÂ²:** 0.77
  - **RMSE:** ~$6,000
- Exported predictions for visualization.

---

## ðŸ“Š **Interactive Dashboard**
Built an interactive Power BI report with:
- **Overview page:** Key cost drivers and average charges.
- **Regional Analysis page:** Average costs by region.
- **Prediction vs Actual page:** Shows model performance and sample predictions.

##  **Tools Used**
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI Desktop

---

## **Key Insights**
- BMI and smoking strongly increase costs.
- Regional differences exist â€” Southeast shows higher average charges.
- Model predicts charges reasonably well for basic linear modeling.
